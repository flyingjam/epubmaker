# epubmaker
Generates EPUBs from sites given an index page

#note

This is old and bad. Please look towards https://github.com/flyingjam/thoth , it's far more stable and written much more cleanly. Thank you.

Has *Soupy*, *PySide* as well as the internal libraries *pyn* and *epub* as dependencies.

pyn.py does most of the work and is, for the most part, documented and written with PEP8.
